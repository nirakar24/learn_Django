## What is Django?

[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/) is a robust web framework known for its clean, pragmatic design. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, emphasizing reusable code and adopting a "batteries-included" philosophy. Key features include an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system, an automatic admin interface, URL routing, a template engine, and robust security features.
